## üöÄ About Me
Hello! I'm Tareq, a **passionate Frontend Developer** based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My journey into web development began with a strong curiosity for how things work, which led me to pursue a Diploma in Computer Science & Engineering. I thrive on building applications that are not only **functional** but also provide a **seamless and intuitive user experience**.

My core expertise lies in the **React ecosystem**, where I build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I'm also comfortable working on the backend with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, enabling me to contribute to full-stack solutions. I am a firm believer in writing **clean, maintainable code**, adhering to **SOLID principles**, and leveraging **design patterns** to create robust and scalable software.

Beyond coding, I'm an avid problem solver, constantly sharpening my analytical skills on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. This dedication to logical challenges directly translates into my development work, helping me approach complex problems with a structured and efficient mindset.
